# toolbox

This is my toolbox ðŸ§°

In this repository I want to keep a list of various software pieces that I like to use.

## Gems

- [rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) - My favourite ruby framework for many years. I use it every day on the job.
- [sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) - When I want to try out smaller web applications, Sinatra is usually my choice. It's very lightweight, but can be enhanced with many many plugins.
- [hanami](https://github.com/hanami/hanami) - Another framework that I experimented with. I like that it has some of my favourite tools baked in, for example rspec and the interactor pattern.
- [rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) - This is the testing framework of my choice. Whether I write unit tests or web acceptance tests with capybara, RSpec gets the job done. [Effective Testing with RSpec 3](https://pragprog.com/titles/rspec3/) helped me a lot to get to know the tool.
- [interactor](https://github.com/collectiveidea/interactor) - When the business logic goes bigger, I like to organize it in _interactors_, so that I can keep my controllers slim and my models focused on DB interactions. The gem provides a common interface and other helpers.
- [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) - To automate tasks that should be run whenever I save a file, I use guard. It runs my specs and rubocop every hour at least 100 times while developing.
- [rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop) - The standard linter for the ruby world. It helps a lot to follow the [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/). After I worked in a project that ran without rubocop for 2 years, I know how much value you get from it.
- [shoulda-matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers) - If I can use rails to write a one-liner validation, why shouldn't I be able to use a one-line test for that?
- [factory-bot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot) - I use `FactoryBot` to generate model instances or their attributes for my specs.
- [database_cleaner](https://github.com/DatabaseCleaner/database_cleaner) - Everything that I write into the DB while testing needs to be cleaned up afterwards. This tool does that for me.
- [faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker) - I am kind of bad when naming test data. `Faker` helps me to generate more sane names, adresses, movie titles and much more.
- [byebug](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug) - The debugger of my choice. When I need more fancy output, I use [pry-byebug](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/pry-byebug).
- [devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) - When I need to introduce authentication to my applications, Device is my tool of choice. It is very powerful, but you can scope out things you don't need.
- [geocoder](https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder) - This helps a lot when you need to work with location services. It features many APIs and integrates seamlessly with my default stack.

## Data Stores

- [mysql](https://www.mysql.com/) - I am most familiar with using MySQL as a datastore.
- [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) - When I run own projects on heroku, I tend to use postgres, as the integration on heroku side is very advanced.
- [redis](https://redis.io/) - For Caching purposes or projects where I don't need a full relation database setup, I use redis.

## Terminal

- [zsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh) - My go-to shell is zsh.
- [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) - Enables easy customization of the shell. Below I list the top 5 of my favorite plugins.

  - [git](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git) - Autocomplete and aliases for git commands.
  - [docker](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/docker) - Autocomplete for docker commands.
  - [rake](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/rake) - Reads out our Rakefile and tasks and autocompletes the command.
  - [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) - Syntax highlighting in the shell. I like that it shows the command in red when it does not exist.
  - [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) - Suggests commands from your history again. Very helpful if you are keen to smash the arrow up button over and over again.

- [iterm](https://iterm2.com/) - The terminal replacement I use. I enjoy splitting the panes and getting notifications when a long-running command finally finishes.
- [thefuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) - You did a small typo? No problem. Just type into the console what you might whisper to yourself and let the magic happen.
- [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) - This nice command gives you a small summary of typical usages for the most commands.
